# Learn-Python
All projects I practised coding on. Please keep in mind that I made them during weekends while learning theory, to try out newly gained knowledge. The algorithms are not perfect, code not optimized, but it works.

GAMES:
1. Sudoku - program that generates random sudoku puzzle and then lets you solve it or solves it for you.
2. Battleship - game based on "Battleships". First place your ships on the board, then battle against IA.
3. Minesweeper - generates random minesweeper board then lets you solve it or solves it for you.
4. Pong - game based on the famous "breakout" game. Allows you to make your own level and save it. Has a secret level in case you win.

Genetic algorithms:
1. Sentence - starts with population of random sentences and through mutations and crossover finds your sentence.
2. Travelling dots - population of random moving dots learn to travel though an obstacle course you created.

Path finding algorithm:
1. Program generates a labyrinth using the algorithm you chose and then finds the shortest path

Machine learning (using sklearn, pyplot and pandas):
1. WineQuality - Different algorithms learn to tell good wine from bad based on a database
  a) Kmeans - finds 5 different types of wine based on residual sugar and fixed acidity (only two so it will be visible on a graph)
  b) Nearest Neighbours - checks the accuracy for the Nearest Neighbours classifier depending on set parameters and plots the results
  c) Random Forest - checks the accuracy for the Random Forest classifier depending on set parameters and plots the results
