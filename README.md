# Learn-Python
This file contains a list of projects I practised coding on. Please keep in mind that I made them during weekends while learning theory, to try out newly gained knowledge. The algorithms are not perfect, code not optimized, but it works.

Games:
Sudoku - program that generates random sudoku puzzle and then lets you solve it or solves it for you.
Battleship - game based on "Battleships". First place your ships on the board, then battle against IA.
Minesweeper - generates random minesweeper board then lets you solve it or solves it for you.
Pong - game based on the famous "breakout" game. Allows you to make your own level and save it. Has a secret level in case you win.
Snake - algorithm controlling the classic game

Genetic algorithms:
Sentence - starts with population of random sentences and through mutations and crossover finds your sentence.
Travelling dots - population of random moving dots learn to travel through an obstacle course you created.

Path finding algorithm:
Labyrinth - Program generates a labyrinth using the algorithm you chose and then finds the shortest path

Machine learning (using sklearn, pyplot and pandas):
WineQuality - Different algorithms learn to tell good wine from bad based on a database 
a) Kmeans - finds 5 different types of wine based on residual sugar and fixed acidity (only two so it will be visible on a graph) 
b) Nearest Neighbours - checks the accuracy for the Nearest Neighbours classifier depending on set parameters and plots the results 
c) Random Forest - checks the accuracy for the Random Forest classifier depending on set parameters and plots the results
Checkers - MiniMax algorithm, with alpha beta pruning and maxdepth,  playing checkers. You can play against the algorithm or make two algorithms play against each other (one has lower max depth than other)
